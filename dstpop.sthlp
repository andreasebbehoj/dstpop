{title:Description}

{pstd}
{cmd:dstpop} facilitate the use of Statistics Denmark's API (DST or "Danmarks Statistik") to download data on Danish population data since 1971.

DST stores population data in four different registries (BEF1, BEF1A, BEF1A07, and FOLK1A). Each registry cover different time periods and have slightly different data structures, which makes DST's API rather cumbersome to use. Importantly, the Structural Reform ("Kommunalreformen") in 2007 combined the previous 271 municipalities into 98 larger municipalities. At the same time, the 16 administrative counties ("amter") were replaced by 5 regions. Some municipalities continued unchanged, while others were combined and split. This introduce a databreach and some municipalities cannot be directly compared geographically (marked with *).

DST's API is documented here: https://www.dst.dk/da/Statistik/statistikbanken/api

{title:Examples}



. import delimited "test.csv", clear encoding(UTF-8)

. rename omr√•de c_kom


Convert and replace old municipality codes with new codes:

. dstpop c_kom, from(oldkom) to(newkom) replace assert


Generate new variable with corresponding regions:

. dstpop c_kom, from(newkom) to(region) gen(c_reg) assert
